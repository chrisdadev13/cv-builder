# CV-Builder

---

## The Project

This is a CV-Builder, created for "The Odin Project", user can add their professional data and download a pdf with all the information at the end. I build this project, in order to learn and practice about React development with Javascript/Typescript
I'm still building this web-app, the user interface and some features are strongly based in [RX Resume](https://rxresu.me/), an open source reactive CV builder.
